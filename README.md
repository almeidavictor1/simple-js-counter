# Simple JS Counter

This is a basic counter web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It was one of my first projects while learning web development. I followed a tutorial as guidance, but figured out several parts myself — including organizing the project files and making the buttons interact with the counter using the DOM.

## 🔧 Features

- Increase, decrease, and reset buttons
- Clean UI with hover effects
- Responsive layout (basic)
- Organized file structure (`index.html`, `style.css`, `index.js`)

## 🚀 How to use

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser and interact with the buttons.

## 🌐 Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📌 Notes

This project marks the start of my web dev journey. I plan to evolve it with:
- Dark mode
- Animated transitions
- Sound effects
- Mobile responsiveness
